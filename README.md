# python-challenge
# 
# This is the Module 3 challenge
# It comprises of 2 python scripts for this homework assignment.
# This will demonstrate the relative speed of Python data
# analysis, compared to VBA script and using excel spreadsheets. 
# The data is given in csv format , referred to as comma 
# separated value , where data elements are separated by commas.
#
# The first part is called PyBank, where given is a csv file 
# called budget_data.csv with 2 columns  , "Date" and 
# "Profit\Losses".
# The python script creates output on screen and to a txt file
# in PyBank\analysis directory.
# The script produces the following:
#   - total number of months in dataset
#   - net total of "Profit/Losses" in dataset
#   - changes over entire period of "Profit/Losses" & 
#     average of changes
#   - greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
#   - greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
#
# The second part is called PyPoll, where given is a csv file 
# called election_data.csv with 3 columns  , "Voter ID",  
# "County" and "Candidate".
# The python script creates output on screen and to a txt file
# in PyPoll\analysis directory.
# The script produces the following:
#   - total number of votes in the election dataset
#   - list of candidates who received votes
#   - number of votes each candidate collected
